**My First Functional App - Kode with Klossy Mobile App Development Camp 2022**

This project is my third iOS app and the first one that is fully functional, created during the Kode with Klossy Mobile App Development Camp 2022. This app allowed me to combine various UI elements and functionalities, providing a deeper understanding of iOS app development.

**Features**

-Personalized Text Display: The main screen displays my name in large text, giving a personalized touch to the app.


-Coding Image: The app continues to use the image of coding on a computer, maintaining a consistent visual theme across my projects.


-"Click Me" Button with Dynamic Text: 
  
  --> A button labeled "Click Me" triggers the display of a different phrase about me each time it's pressed. This functionality was an introduction to adding interactivity and dynamic content in an app.

-Navigation to a Secondary Page:

  --> The app includes a second button that, when pressed, navigates to another page.
  
  
  -->This secondary page displays a text box with the message "This is me" and a collage of photos representing things I like.
 
  
  -->A "Back" button on this page allows users to return to the main screen, introducing the concept of navigation between views.

**Purpose**

The purpose of this app was to create a fully functional and interactive experience, building on the foundational skills I learned in my previous apps. It allowed me to practice more advanced features such as dynamic text display and navigation between different screens.

**Learning Experience**

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in:

-Implementing dynamic text that changes based on user interaction.


-Adding navigation between different views in the app, making the experience more interactive.


-Designing a simple but effective user interface that showcases elements of my personality and interests.
